# Symptom-Based Diagnostic Decision Support AI System (DDSAS)

A machine learning project predicting the likelihood of chronic diseases based on patient symptoms and health metrics. This end-to-end system demonstrates MLOps principles, with data preprocessing, model training, MLflow experiment tracking, and a local Streamlit UI demo.  

It provides a **data-driven decision support tool** for healthcare settings.

# Business Objective

The **DiseaseFeatureClassifiers** delivers significant value to all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. By leveraging **AI-driven symptom analysis**, the system **increases diagnostic precision and productivity**, reducing the cognitive and administrative burden on **frontline healthcare professionals**. It **improves patient outcomes** through timely and accurate risk assessment, while offering a **suggestive approach to reduce operational costs** for clinics and hospitals by optimizing workflows and minimizing unnecessary tests or interventions. Additionally, the tool helps **free up critical resources**, including emergency room capacity, enabling healthcare institutions to focus on patients with the most urgent needs, thereby enhancing **overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness**.
