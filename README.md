# Symptom-Based Diagnostic Decision Support AI System (DDSAS)

A machine learning project predicting the likelihood of chronic diseases based on patient symptoms and health metrics. This end-to-end system demonstrates MLOps principles, with data preprocessing, model training, MLflow experiment tracking, and a local Streamlit UI demo.  

It provides a **data-driven decision support tool** for healthcare settings.

## 🎯 Project Overview 

The stakeholders of DDSAS include:

- **Physicians & Healthcare Providers:** Aid in disease diagnosis, improve accuracy, and reduce errors.  
- **Patients:** Benefit from timely and accurate diagnosis for better health outcomes.  
- **Healthcare Institutions & Clinics:** Improve workflows, standardize care, and reduce operational costs.  
- **Health IT & Data Scientists:** Build, track, and maintain ML models efficiently.  
- **Regulatory Bodies:** Ensure compliance with safety, ethics, and medical standards.  
- **Insurance Companies:** Optimize cost-effectiveness by minimizing misdiagnosis.  
- **Medical Educators & Researchers:** Train professionals and advance diagnostic methods.  
- **Patients’ Families & Caregivers:** Indirectly benefit from improved care decisions.  

This project helps all stakeholders make **informed, timely decisions** in healthcare.

## Clinical Risks

It is important to note that DDSAS is designed as a diagnostic support tool intended to assist front-line healthcare professionals. Patient well-being is central to our approach; the system is not meant to deliver definitive diagnoses based solely on symptom patterns. Instead, it aims to support nurses, physicians, and telehealth providers by offering data-driven predictions that complement their clinical expertise.

Rather than presenting a conclusive prognosis, the tool provides probabilistic estimates of potential diseases based on reported symptoms, helping guide clinicians toward more informed decisions and appropriate next steps in patient care.

## Dataset
The dataset selected for this task is “Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning” (Kaggle link). It was chosen because it includes a large number of symptoms (features) and corresponding prognoses (target classes). Given its size and structure, the dataset is well-suited for this project, as it reflects the scale of real-world healthcare data, where hospitals manage large patient populations and numerous clinical variables. This allows us to test whether our model can effectively handle datasets of comparable complexity.

The dataset is already divided into training and testing subsets. In total, it contains data from 4,962 individuals with 133 possible symptoms and 42 diagnosed diseases. However, there is no accompanying metadata, so additional information such as patient demographics or age distributions cannot be analyzed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

It is important to note that while the open-source dataset has already been split into a training and testing components, inspection of the sizes of these dataframes shows that the testing dataset represents only 1% of the training set, which according to data science and model training best practices is inadequate.  To remedy this issue, we opted to recombine the training and testing dataset, and use <pre> sklearn train_test_split </pre> to create a new test dataset from 20% of patients.
