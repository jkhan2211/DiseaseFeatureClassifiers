# Chronic Disease Risk Predictor (DDSAS)

A machine learning project predicting the likelihood of chronic diseases based on patient symptoms and health metrics. This end-to-end system demonstrates MLOps principles, with data preprocessing, model training, MLflow experiment tracking, and a local Streamlit UI demo.  

It provides a **data-driven decision support tool** for healthcare settings.
